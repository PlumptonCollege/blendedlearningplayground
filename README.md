# Blended Learning Playground
## www.blendedlearningplayground.com
In 2017 Plumpton College (www.plumpton.ac.uk) was awarded a grant from the Education & Training Foundation to undertake applied research in blended learning. As part of the project we published the Blended Learning Playground to share our discoveries. Thanks to Brighton University's Centre for Learning & Teaching (https://staff.brighton.ac.uk/clt/) for sharing their own applied research. Specical thanks to Creative Education (www.creativeeducation.co.uk) and FE Sussex (www.fesussex.org.uk) for project support and mentorship.
